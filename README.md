# Movie Website Project
The movie website project is a python project that generates an html page for a list of movies. For each movie the website displays the movie poster image and title. Clicking on the poster image loads the movie trailer for each movie.

## How to Run the Application
1. Download the Media folder containing the following modules:
    *  `media.py`
    *  `entertainment_center.py`
    *  `fresh_tomatoes.py`
2. Open the `entertainment_center.py` module and run `entertainment_center.py`
3. The movie website should generate and open in a new web browser.

## Modifying the Application
To change the movies that display open `entertainment.py` and modify the instances of `class Movie`. 

To change and modify the functionality of `class Movie` open the file `media.py` and update as desired.

To modify the way the website displayed open `fresh_tomatoes.py` and modify the html code.
